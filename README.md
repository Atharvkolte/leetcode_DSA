Here’s a comprehensive **README.md** draft for your repository **leetcode_DSA** that you can paste into your GitHub repo (and tweak as needed).

# leetcode_DSA

*C++ Solutions Repository for LeetCode & DSA Challenges*

## 🚀 About

This repository contains a collection of algorithm and data-structure problem solutions (mainly from LeetCode) implemented in C++. The aim is to build a strong DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) foundation useful for competitive programming, job interviews, and general problem‐solving practice.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
leetcode_DSA/
├── <problem-id>_<problem-name>.cpp       # Single C++ file per problem
├── README.md                              # This file
└── (future folders may include topics/tags)  
```

* Each file is named in the format: `ID_ProblemName.cpp` (e.g., `1526_Minimum_Number_of_Increments_on_Subarrays_to_Form_a_Target_Array.cpp`)
* Only C++ is used in this repo (100% according to GitHub languages data) ([GitHub][1])
* Problems cover a variety of topics: arrays, linked lists, grids, bitwise operations, etc.

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

* Organise a growing list of solved problems to track progress and reinforce learning.
* Provide clean, readable C++ implementations for reference and reuse.
* Aid interview preparation by building up speed, accuracy, and pattern recognition in DSA.
* Eventually categorise by topic (e.g., “Sliding Window”, “Graphs”, “Dynamic Programming”) to make navigation easier.

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atharvkolte/leetcode_DSA.git
   ```
2. Browse or search for a problem by its ID or name.
3. Open the `.cpp` file and study the solution approach, comments, and implementation.
4. To compile and run (example):

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 1526_Minimum_Number_of_Increments_on_Subarrays_to_Form_a_Target_Array.cpp -o sol
   ./sol
   ```
5. To contribute:

   * Solve a new problem → add the `.cpp` file with the correct naming format.
   * Include a brief comment at the top describing the approach / complexity.
   * Submit a pull request (if collaborative) or merge into your own fork.

## 🧠 Learning & Interview Focus Areas

* **Complexities**: Each solution should aim for optimal time & space where possible.
* **Clean Code**: Use meaningful variable names, comments, and structured logic.
* **Patterns**: Focus on frequent DSA patterns (two-pointers, sliding window, BFS/DFS, dynamic programming, bit-manipulation).
* **Edge Cases**: Think through and test boundary conditions (empty inputs, large constraints, special values).
* **Scalability**: Though these are single-problem files, consider how the logic would extend or be reused in larger systems (e.g., production code, libraries).

## 🔖 Future Roadmap

* Add a **topic index** (e.g., `DP/`, `Graphs/`, `Greedy/`) to group problems by category.
* Maintain a **table** or `CSV` of solved problems (ID, name, link, topic, difficulty).
* Add **unit tests** for each solution to verify correctness automatically.
* Include **README sections per topic** with quick pattern summaries.
* Expand to other languages (e.g., Python, Java) if desired for comparison.
